# learning_dart

I find necessary to learn the language before Flutter. I guess I could just hack and pretend to write Dart with a Kotlin or Java mindset. Instead of cutting corners, I am taking a good amount of time to feel very confortable with Dart just like I feel now after [learning Kotlin](https://github.com/juanmendez/learning-kotlin). I break each learning subjects into different git branches.
