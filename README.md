# generics

Most `oop` languages use generics. Lets see what's like to write generics in `Dart`.

So generics seem pretty straightforward. Just like in Java generics are defined at the class level declaration.
And similar to Kotlin we can define our generics based on the method.

`TypeReturn methodName <T> (T argument){ return typeReturn; }`
